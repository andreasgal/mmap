# mmap

mmap(2) bindings for node.js that work in 0.10

##Â Installing

    npm install -g

## Usage

    mmap = require("mmap")
    buffer = mmap.map(n_bytes, protection, flags, fd, offset)

While a finaliser is installed to automatically unmap buffer, you can
force it to unmap immediately with:

    buffer.unmap()
